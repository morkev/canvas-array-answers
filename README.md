# Canvas – Multiple Answer Array
Prints all the correct &amp; incorrect answers on a quiz with multiple questions in Canvas.

The code in this repository doesn't work any longer for quizzes with only one attempt – if you do, however, have multiple attemps you can still use it (data will be thrown in an array). As of now, I will keep the code alive – maybe someone can create something useful based on the current structure.
